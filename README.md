ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Data Preparation
ðŸ”¹ Objective

Prepare the Telco Customer Churn dataset for machine learning by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and ensuring data consistency.
ðŸ”¹ Steps Performed

Dataset Upload

Loaded the dataset (Telco_Customer_Churn_Dataset.csv) into Google Colab using Pandas.

Data Exploration

Checked dataset shape, column data types, and summary statistics.

Identified missing values and categorical variables.

Handling Missing Values

Numerical columns: Replaced missing values with the mean.

Categorical columns: Replaced missing values with the mode.

Encoding Categorical Variables

Binary categorical features (Yes/No): Applied Label Encoding (0/1).

Multi-category features: Applied One-Hot Encoding using pd.get_dummies() (drop_first=True to avoid multicollinearity).

Verification

Confirmed no missing values remained.

Verified all features were numeric and dataset was ML-ready.
ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Google Colab
ðŸ”¹ Skills Practiced

âœ… Data preprocessing techniques
âœ… Handling missing values
âœ… Categorical variable encoding
âœ… Preparing data for ML pipeline

ðŸ”¹ Outcome

The dataset is now clean, consistent, and machine-learning ready, forming the foundation for further tasks like data splitting, feature selection, and model training.
ðŸ“Œ Task 2: Data Splitting
ðŸ”¹ Objective

Split the Telco Customer Churn dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets for fair model training and evaluation, ensuring the split is representative of the target variable distribution.

ðŸ”¹ Steps Performed

Dataset Upload

Loaded the preprocessed dataset (Telco_Customer_Churn_Dataset.csv) into Google Colab.

Feature/Target Separation

Defined features (X) as all columns except Churn.

Defined target (y) as the Churn column.

Train-Test Split

Used scikit-learnâ€™s train_test_split function.

Parameters:

test_size=0.2 â†’ 20% for testing, 80% for training

random_state=42 â†’ ensures reproducibility

stratify=y â†’ maintains class balance of churn vs. non-churn customers

Basic Checks

Verified training/testing set shapes.

Confirmed target variable distribution is preserved in both splits.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Google Colab

ðŸ”¹ Skills Practiced

âœ… Data splitting methodologies
âœ… Understanding training/testing dataset requirements
âœ… Ensuring reproducible and representative splits

ðŸ”¹ Outcome

The dataset was successfully divided into train (80%) and test (20%) sets, ensuring fair model evaluation and avoiding data leakage in future tasks.
