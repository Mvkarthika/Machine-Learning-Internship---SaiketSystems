ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Data Preparation
ðŸ”¹ Objective

Prepare the Telco Customer Churn dataset for machine learning by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and ensuring data consistency.
ðŸ”¹ Steps Performed

Dataset Upload

Loaded the dataset (Telco_Customer_Churn_Dataset.csv) into Google Colab using Pandas.

Data Exploration

Checked dataset shape, column data types, and summary statistics.

Identified missing values and categorical variables.

Handling Missing Values

Numerical columns: Replaced missing values with the mean.

Categorical columns: Replaced missing values with the mode.

Encoding Categorical Variables

Binary categorical features (Yes/No): Applied Label Encoding (0/1).

Multi-category features: Applied One-Hot Encoding using pd.get_dummies() (drop_first=True to avoid multicollinearity).

Verification

Confirmed no missing values remained.

Verified all features were numeric and dataset was ML-ready.
